--- SM2 ---------------

1. Policy network introduction

2. Actions introduction

6. Construction of the module interface
	- Define how to initialise the beliefs of the agents (from the model or based on surveys)
	- Define how instruments should be implemented into the system/policy context

7. First full SM model runs
	
	- 



Regarding the policy instruments:
